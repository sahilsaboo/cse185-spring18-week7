# Week 7 Literature Review questions

Please replace the content of this file with 10 questions, due by your lab time on Tuesday, May 15.

1. What other protins are encoded for by influenza A besides hemagglutinin and neuramidase glycoproteins?

2. What are the 5 immunogenic epitopes in H1 and H3?

3. What positions in the HA gene are known to alter its antigenic epitopes?

4. How could vaccines take quasispecies into consideration? 

5. How can RVD estimate context specific error at every base position, ie what does it base the context on?

6. Is it possible to predict for mutations and include potentially occuring mutated viruses in vaccines?

7. How exactly does the MAF detection threshold work, how did they decide on 0.5% and what does it represent?

8. What relevance can we pull from mutations that were exclusive to a given patient (Bottom of Page 5), shouldn't we be looking at mutations that are in a majority (or at least more than one) patient?

9. How did they consider the amino acid position of the mutation compared to the HA domains that had already been characterized?

10. Since many patients had different mutations that changed the amino acids coded for, how can we tell which changes are relevant and which are not?
